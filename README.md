# Happy Sad Image Classifier

In an image classification project aimed at detecting happy and sad expressions, we collected and preprocessed a balanced dataset of labeled images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras, we trained the model to distinguish between happy and sad faces. The dataset was split into training and validation sets, and techniques such as early stopping and dropout were employed to prevent overfitting. The model achieved a 90% accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating its effectiveness in emotion detection. Future steps include fine-tuning the model and deploying it for real-world applications.
